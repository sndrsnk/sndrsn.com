<h1>Artist Statement</h1>

<section class="about">
    Kevin Sanderson is an experimental sound artist and programmer based in Cork, Ireland. His practice is rooted in a reciprocal relationship between internal and external states of awareness through deep listening, field recording, and improvisation, serving as a continuous flow between himself and the natural world. Using this connection as a catalyst for his work, he deconstructs and recontextualises source material into imagined soundscapes and live performances. 

    The artist blends sound design with physical control and chaotic manipulation using modular synthesis, self-built instruments, and found objects. In this way, immediacy and tactility are intrinsic to his process, enabling him to explore the complexity and interactivity of sound as an unfamiliar instrument. By transmuting recognisable sound objects into new forms that retain their inherent qualities, the artist seeks to reshape our associations with the ordinary by means of otherworldly sonic narratives.

    In addition to his soundscape compositions and performances, Kevin develops digital performance instruments, hardware controllers, and algorithmic compositions using MaxMSP, SuperCollider, and CSound, fusing his creative practice with a diverse technical background. He is a standing committee member for a newly emerging Art Science Collective <a href="https://artandgeology.ie"><em>The Fold</em></a> in Cork that connects artists with geology through focus groups, knowledge sharing workshops, and field trips.

    Kevin recently completed an MA in <em>Experimental Sound Practice</em> at University College Cork in 2025.
