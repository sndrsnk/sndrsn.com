                <em>Source</em> is an immersive sound installation inspired by the research of geologist Dr. Jess Franklin which investigates the provenance of ancient sandstones, developed for <em>Féile na Bealtaine</em>, Dingle, Co. Kerry. Her work unravels the history of their individual sand grains, from weathering through to transport, deposition, and burial. Developed in collaboration with sound artist Kevin Sanderson, this installation simulates the enormity of geological time, serving as a sonic narrative that traces the long journey of sand grains and the complex processes which form our natural landscapes.
